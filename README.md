2023 Final Year Project. A company that supplies tyres and spare parts for transport fleets. When there's a breakdown the company is contacted, arranges new parts and/or tyres and arranges to get it fixed in the nearest garage. They want an App that can automate the process. Servers record all incidents and track all vehicles.
